# Sentiment.py
+ The program calculates the twitter sentiment score of two words and compares them before displaying which term has a higher score.
+ The program runs a for loop that runs twice.
+ Each for loop iteration first prompts the user for a search term.
+ The program then searches through the twitter stream for the first 10 tweets that contain the search term.
+ The program then calculates a sentiment score for the search term using a dictionary of keywords that have a sentiment score for each term.
+ After the sentiment score for the term is calculated, the score is stored in an integer variable.
+ After the two iterations are ran and the two sentiment scores are calculated for each term, an if-else statement compares the two sentiment scores and determines which search term currently has the most positive sentiment on twitter and print the results.
